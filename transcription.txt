 Good morning, how have you been feeling lately? Hello doctor, my name is Prajeel. I have been experiencing some discomfort in my chest and sharpness of breath. It's been going on for a few weeks now. I'm sorry to hear that. Can you describe the chest discomfort? Is it like a sharp pain or more like pressure? It's more like a pressure in the center of my chest. Sometimes it feels like a squeezing sensation and it often radiates to my left arm. I see, that's concerning. Have you noticed if these symptoms occur during physical activity or at rest? It seems to happen more often when I'm active, like when I'm climbing stairs or walking briskly. But it also happens when I'm just sitting at my desk. Okay, that's important information. How about other symptoms like dizziness, nausea or excessive sweating during these episodes? Yes, I have felt dizzy and sweaty a couple of times when it happened. No nausea though. Thank you for sharing that. Given your symptoms, I'd like to order some tests. We should do an electrocardiogram to check your heart's electrical activity and a stress test to see how your heart respond to physical exhaustion. We'll also schedule a blood test to check your cholesterol levels, cardiac enzymes and hemoglobin content. Alright doctor, I'll do whatever is necessary. Welcome back, I have the test results with me. I'm eager to hear how things look doctor. Firstly, your ECG showed some irregularities in your heart's electrical activity. Specifically, we observed ST-segment depression, which can indicate reduced blood flow to the heart muscle. What does that mean doctor? It suggests that your heart might not be getting enough oxygen during physical exhaustion, which aligns with your symptoms. Now your stress test results were also concerning. Your heart rate increased significantly during the test. And you experienced chest discomfort, shortness of breath and fatigue. That sounds worrisome doctor. Yes, it is a matter of concern. Based on these findings, it's possible that you have coronary artery disease. We also received the blood test, which indicate the following. Your LDL cholesterol was 150 mg per g. Your cardiac enzymes were elevated and your hemoglobin content was 13.5 g. What's the plan now doctor? We need to further evaluate your condition. I'd like to schedule a coronary angiography, a procedure that will allow us to visualize your coronary arteries and assess any blockages. Depending on the findings, we may recommend angioplasty and stent placement or even coronary artery bypass surgery. I understand doctor. Please do what's necessary to help me. Of course, we're here to provide you with the best care possible. In the meantime, let's continue discussing lifestyle changes, medication and post-procedural recovery plans.
